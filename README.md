# Coursera Applied Data Science Capstone Project

Completed by Martti Nirkko on 5th December, 2022.

This repository contains all the notebooks and scripts used to complete the final data science project of the Coursera module "IBM Data Science".
In this Professional Certificate, learners developed and honed hands-on skills in Data Science and Machine Learning.

### Executive summary
* In this project, criteria for successful booster landings of SpaceX launches were evaluated. The relevant features that were investigated included payload mass, launch site and orbit.
* Data collection was performed using a combination of available datasets and webscraping. Data cleaning and wrangling was used to fill in missing data or convert it to numerical values.
* Next, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was done using SQL queries and Python libraries, in particular the seaborn package for data visualization. Interactive visual analytics and the creation of a dashboard allow for a high level presentation of the data to management.
* Finally, a set of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms was used to predict the success or failure of future launches. For this, the dataset was split into train and test data.
* We found that the percentage of successful launches increased significantly with time. Certain launch sites and orbits had a higher success rate, as did missions with higher payloads. Predictive modeling yielded 83% accuracy for predicting successful landings.
